## Software Engineering

In the early stages of my project, I struggled with the decision of how to present my game to users. Whether to go for a 3D or 2D game. Considering the tight two-month timeframe and my skepticism about learning Pygame quick enough, I opted for a terminal-based game. I chose a terminal-based game because it's easier to make within my tight deadline, and it makes the development process simpler.

To refine the user experience, I looked closely at how people can type things into the game. Python's native input() didn't suit well for my use case; it was too tedious to type a menu option and then press enter. Research led me to the keyboard library, offering a solution that allowed users to input without the enter key, ultimately solidifying my decision to stick with a terminal game.

Beyond input considerations, I worked on organizing how my code should be put together using a method called object-oriented programming. The goal was to keep the codebase organized and neat, adhering to OOP principles for a well-structured design.

Simply put, I tried to make my plan practical and flexible. I wanted the game to be fun for users, but I had to deal with the limits of time and learning new things. So, I adjusted and improved my project as I went along, making it work smoothly in the two months I had.
