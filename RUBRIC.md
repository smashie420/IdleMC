  * Provide a clickable link to a video recording demonstrating the working application. (2pt)
  * Write a test script for how to fully test the program including a numbered step by step walk through for manual testing. If unit tests are provided, make sure to include that process in the test script. (4pt)
  * Test script includes information on expected input methods or input values to be used as part of the testing and what values will trigger errors (4pt)

  * Markdown on RUBRIC.md is properly formatted. (2pt)
* **Programming of the Application (17 points total)**
  * GitHub Commits: Weekly programming commits showing progress from Week 9 - Week 14. (6pt)
  * Write a minimum of 300 - 600 source lines of code (sloc) as shown in the GitHub repo. Provided markdown files and third-party libraries or modules do not count towards the line count but may be used. (10pt)
  * Application is [documented using Docstrings](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) appropriately with comments used to flag specific blocks of code. (2pt)
  * Application code is well organized and has appropriate whitespace for readability. (3pt)
* **Structure of the Application Code (22 points total)**
  * The majority of the core application code written by the student uses Object-Oriented Programming classes and techniques. (15pt)
  * The main program file uses functional or procedural programming techniques to start the application and instantiate objects from classes. (7pt)
* **Demonstration of Project (6 points total)**
  * Video recording is a minimum of 3-5 minutes in length, but may be longer. (2pt)
  * Student verbally describes how to start and use the application. (2pt)
  * Student discusses the testing process as part of the project and the verbal description matches the written description. (2pt)

## Student Grading Rubric (25pt)

The student provided rubric is worth 25 points and is specific to the individual student directed project description. Students may decide how to divide up the points in consultation with the instructor who will complete a Pull Request with changes that you must successfully merge into your code. Specific goals with point allocations must be given in the rubric to be accepted or the instructor may choose to modify the rubric or points distribution at any time.

* Student Grading Description 1 (X pt)
* Student Grading Description 2 (X pt)
* Student Grading Description 3 (X pt)
* Student Grading Description 4 (X pt)
* Student Grading Description 5 (X pt)

Total Points: 100

## Additional Grading Notes

* If no modifications are made to the Student Grading Rubric, **no points will be awarded for that section**.
* Customers will not pay for programs that do not work, programs that do not run due to syntax errors will receive **0 Points**.
* All programs must have your Github URL submitted in Canvas via the assignment page. Unsubmitted Github repos will receive **0 Points**.
* Programs that have been submitted and received a grade will not be regraded, unless the instructor makes a request for changes. If a program is eligible for regrading, it is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor when the program is ready for regrading.
* Professional programmers are required to hit tough deadlines, late projects will loose **20 Points**.
* While automated unit tests may be used, manual testing of your code is also required. Hint, if you write a unit test, that counts towards the line count.
* Submitted code may be subject to inspection by the [Measure of Software Similarity (MOSS)](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/). to check for similarity in programs that may be related to plagiarism. It is up to the instructor to determine if plagiarism is occurring.
* Use of AI to assist your programming is prohibited. The goal is for you to learn how to program. Projects that utilize AI to write code will receive **0 Points**.
* Programmers need to keep any confidential information secure and ensure that it is never published to GitHub. Confidential information published to GitHub will loose **5 Points**.
